# Intermit

Intermit is an early stage exploration of how to structure digital work so it can be put down and picked up again across long stretches of time. We are at the ideation phase, thinking through lightweight practices that could help digital public goods, open projects, standards work, research outputs, and civic infrastructure remain understandable and restartable even after long pauses. The goal is to outline something far simpler than heavy archival standards like ISO 16363, while still helping work survive changes in tools, teams, and attention.

Many digital efforts fade not because the ideas are weak, but because continuity depends on unstable tools, undocumented knowledge, or people who eventually move on. Intermit aims to describe patterns that help important work stay usable for future contributors, including people who were not present at the start.

## Progressive Longevity

Progressive longevity is the idea that every project should have a simple, stable foundation that stays usable far into the future. Modern tools, automation, and AI can provide speed and convenience, but they should sit on top of a minimal core that remains clear, plain, and resilient. If the advanced layers vanish, the essential layer should still work.

This can be especially important for digital public goods, standards efforts, and research work where teams dissolve and reform over many years. A long lived specification, dataset, or codebase often only survives if the core parts are human readable, documented, and not tied to a single tool or service. A future Progressive Longevity Framework might include small conventions, examples, and checklists that help teams design this stable core without adding complexity.

## Tacit Burden

Tacit burden refers to the hidden complexity inside tools, systems, and datasets. Some technologies look simple but contain years of accumulated decisions and edge cases. These become extremely difficult to recreate, port, or hand off.

Examples include:
- regular expression engines with subtle differences and decades of heuristics
- Unicode text shaping systems like HarfBuzz
- compilers with long histories of undocumented behavior relied on in the wild
- scientific datasets shaped by tacit institutional knowledge
- proprietary or human curated corpora such as the Pandora Music Genome Project
- machine learning pipelines built on training data that cannot be reproduced

Intermit is exploring ways to make these hidden layers more visible so contributors understand what makes certain components hard. One possible example is a Tacit Burden Rating System that classifies how difficult something is to recreate, paired with patterns for documenting edge cases, quirks, and historical decisions. The aim is not to eliminate complexity but to make it understandable and findable.

## Modular Survivability

Large initiatives often fail as complete units even when important pieces could have survived independently. Modular survivability focuses on designing work so that individual components can remain useful even if the full project slows down or ends.

This applies to software libraries, specifications, government digital services, metadata schemas, curated datasets, and research tools. A modular design allows key parts to be preserved, migrated, or adopted by others without requiring the whole project to be active. Future guides might include patterns for separating long lived components from short lived ones, writing clear metadata for each part, and structuring repositories so durable pieces can stand alone.

## How to Get Involved

Intermit welcomes collaborators, curious readers, and constructive critics.  
If you are thinking about long term usability, digital public goods, standards work, or ways to make projects easier to resume, we would love to hear from you. Open an issue or start a discussion. We keep things simple and friendly.  ♡
